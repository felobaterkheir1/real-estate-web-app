  /* Sure, I can provide an example of a delivery services app with front-end, UI/UX design, and back-end features, along with an estimated time for each stage of development and the project as a whole. Here's a breakdown:

Front-end:

    User registration and login (20 hours): Users should be able to create an account and log in to the app securely.

    Home screen (40 hours): The home screen should include features such as order tracking, search bar, and delivery history.

    Order placement (60 hours): The order placement feature should include the ability to select items, view prices, select payment methods, and choose a delivery location.

    Payment processing (40 hours): The app should integrate with payment processors such as PayPal or Stripe to enable secure and fast transactions.

    Notifications (20 hours): The app should send push notifications to users regarding order status, promotions, and other updates.

UI/UX Design:

    Wireframing and prototyping (40 hours): The design team should create wireframes and prototypes of the app's interface to ensure optimal user experience.

    User interface design (80 hours): The UI design should include the app's logo, color scheme, typography, and navigation structure.

    User experience design (80 hours): The UX design should include features such as intuitive interface */
